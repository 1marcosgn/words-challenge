//  This Singleton allows to control the Logistic of the game, has control over the current words
//  available in the Challenge, knows as well once a Challenge is resolved and if a Set of elements
//  selected by the user matches any of the available location for the Current Challenge, it can be
//  used by the Interactor to evaluate user selection.
